## 6. Stationarity Check

### 6.1 Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
   - Utilize the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to assess the stationarity of the time series.
   - The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the time series has a unit root (non-stationary).
   - Interpret the p-value to determine the stationarity status.

### 6.2 Transformation for Stationarity
   - If the time series is found to be non-stationary:
      - Apply transformations such as differencing to remove trends or seasonality.
      - Log transformations can be useful for stabilizing variance.
      - Experiment with other methods based on the nature of observed patterns.

### 6.3 Visual Inspection
   - Visualize the time series before and after transformations to assess the impact on stationarity.
   - Utilize plots like rolling statistics to visually confirm stationarity.

### 6.4 Post-Transformation Checks
   - Re-run the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on the transformed series.
   - Ensure the transformed series satisfies stationarity assumptions.

## 7. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Analysis
   - Plot ACF and PACF to identify potential lag orders for autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components.

## 8. Model Selection

In this section, we will choose an appropriate Time Series model for predicting Walmart Inc. (WMT) stock prices. Common models for Time Series Analysis include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). The selection will be based on the AIC/BIC values and model diagnostics.

### 8.1 ARIMA Model

   - Train an initial ARIMA model with selected parameters.
   - Analyze model residuals and ensure no patterns or trends are left.

#### 8.1.2 Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate the ARIMA model on the testing set.
   - Calculate relevant performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

#### 8.1.3 Diagnostics
   - Examine ACF and PACF plots of residuals for further insights.
   - Check for normality and independence of residuals.

### 8.2 SARIMA Model

#### 8.2.1 Model Training
   - Train an initial SARIMA model with appropriate seasonal parameters.
   - Examine model diagnostics to ensure adequacy.

#### 8.2.2 Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate the SARIMA model on the testing set.
   - Compare performance metrics with the ARIMA model.

#### 8.2.3 Diagnostics
   - Conduct residual analysis and address any issues.
   - Verify that the SARIMA model captures both trend and seasonality effectively.

### 8.3 Model Comparison

#### 8.3.1 AIC/BIC Comparison
   - Compare the AIC/BIC values of the ARIMA and SARIMA models.
   - Choose the model with lower AIC/BIC values, indicating a better fit.

#### 8.3.2 Final Model Selection
   - Select the final Time Series model (ARIMA or SARIMA) based on comprehensive evaluation.
   - Justify the choice and discuss any trade-offs.

The chosen model will be used for forecasting in the subsequent sections. It's crucial to ensure the selected model aligns with the characteristics of the Walmart Inc. (WMT) stock price time series data.
